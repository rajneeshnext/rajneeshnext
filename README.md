🚀 Building Scalable Systems for Rentals, Automation & API-Driven Products

Hi, I’m Rajneesh — a full-stack developer with 12+ years of experience building production-ready systems for rental businesses, startups, and growing teams.

I specialize in property tech, automation, and API-first development, turning complex workflows into fast, reliable, and scalable tools. My work spans mobile apps, booking platforms, backend systems, and integrations that save time, reduce manual effort, and scale cleanly.

I currently focus heavily on vacation rental platforms, direct booking systems, and performance-optimized Flutter & WordPress applications.
